# Kangaroo Detection & YOLO Model Retraining
This project is a Django-based web application that:

Uploads images and detects kangaroos using a YOLOv8 model.

Allows users to manually annotate missing kangaroos and send the images for retraining.

Iteratively(here i=3) retrains the model using Google Colab and updates the YOLO model for better performance.

Visualizes the improvement in performance over multiple retraining iterations.
